# gervifonn

The gervifonn is a device to access music stored in a digital music library by interacting with physical CD cases.

## Features
The gervifonn displays the currently playing album. You can change the volume, pause playback or skip to the previous/next song. When you put a CD case onto the gervifonn and press the knob, it uses an AI to recognize the album you want to play.

## Name
The name "gervifonn" derives from the icelandic words "gervigreind" (Artificial Intelligence) and "f√≥nn" (Record Player).

## Components
### Case
![Gervifonn case](case/gervifonn.png "Gervifonn case")
The case is 3D printed. The [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) source and generated STL files can be found under [case](case). The case is made from three parts, for assembly 12 M3 bolts and 8 M3 nuts are needed.
### Hardware
The heart of the gervifonn is a [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).
Additionally the following parts were used (links to amazon.de, not sponsored):
* [Raspberry Pi Camera Revision 1.3](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07CMXJLXR/)
* [3.5 inch 320\*480 Resolution Touch Screen](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01CNLYL1C/)
* [12mm pushbuttons](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075YNQQ8J)
* [KY-040 Rotary Encoder](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07CMVQHLT)
* [Knob for the Rotary Encoder](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B007JV6MAK)
* [10 Pin 2,54mm Pitch flat ribbon cable](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07H9RQM5W/)
* A bit of extra wiring
* Micro-SD card
* Power supply for Raspberry Pi 3

### Software on the device
The software running on the gervifonn can be found under [src](src). Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and place [src\gervifonn.desktop](src\gervifonn.desktop) into the /home/pi/.config/autostart/ directory of your raspberry. You might want to adapt the path to the music directory, the hostname of the [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) server, and the (Snapcast)[https://github.com/badaix/snapcast] server and client.

### Software for training the AI
The AI-model needs to be trained on a more powerfull machine than a raspberry pi. A GPU with CUDA support is recommended, see [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#install_cuda_with_apt) for installation hints for the required libraries. To train the model use [training/train_gervifonn.py](training/train_gervifonn.py), with the path to your music folder and a folder with background images as arguments (details see below).
The resulting `gervifonn.model` needs to be converted to a `gervifonn.tflite` model and placed together with the generated `labels.txt` on your raspberry pi in the same folder as [src\gervifonn.py].

## Prerequesites
The gervifonn currently expects the following environment:
### Music library
The music library should be structured in the way [Jack](https://github.com/jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack) creates it, meaning one folder per Artist with subfolders for each album. Samplers are stored in the `Various` folder.

In addition, a cover image must be present in each folder, named `cover.png`. Optionally, you can place additional cover images in a subfolder called `gervifonn` inside each album. This will also be done by the gervifonn when you are using it.

As albums with multiple CDs only have one cover, only place the `cover.png` in the first folder and create symlinks called `next` linking to the following CD.

### Music Player Daemon
The actual playback of the music is handled by the (Music Player Daemon)[https://www.musicpd.org/]. The MPD should be configured to read in your music library and should be reachable from the gervifonn (without authentification). If you don't have an extra machine, it should be fine to install the MPD on the gervifonn as well.

### Scnapcast
The audio is streamed from the MPD via (Snapcast)[https://github.com/badaix/snapcast] to the actual playback devices. The volume of one Snapcast client can be controlled by the gervifonn.
