# gervifonn

The gervifonn is a device to access music stored in a digital music library by interacting with physical CD cases.

## Features
The gervifonn displays the currently playing album. You can change the volume, pause playback or skip to the previous/next song. When you put a CD case onto the gervifonn and press the knob, it uses an AI to recognize the album you want to play.

## Name
The name "gervifonn" derives from the icelandic words "gervigreind" (Artificial Intelligence) and "f√≥nn" (Record Player).
